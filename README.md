# PyDifferentiate

Find derivative of fully parenthesised expression having binary operators.

For more information on how to find the derivative using my python implementation, you can have a look at [example code](example.py). You can use the [reference](Reference.pdf) for a more detailed documentation.

## Disclaimer
This work was part of my course (COL100) assignment and a small part of this was implemented by Professor during the lecture for illustartion purposes. However, several modifications have been done on the code to arrive at this stage, which now supports trigonometric, logarithmic and even composite functions.
